<div id= "problems">
  <h1> Problems </h1>
  <p>The only problem I ran into was beginning the lab based off of Wes doing it during <br>
    the lecture, and then realizing he did it differently in the example and having to make<br>
     sure my js was fully functioning. Because of this, it took longer than it would've.</p>
