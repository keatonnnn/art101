<h2>Challenge.</h2>
The challenge this time was to create a working function using js and implement it on this page. did you get the popup?

<h2>Problems.</h2>

<p> Biggest problems I ran into during this task were helping Jacob <br>
  with his js (to no avail) and also just figuring out everything I <br>
  was asking the function to do. </p>
<h2>Results.</h2>
