<p>The challenge was to do what I've done below, you'll see there's an input <br>
  field for you and it's gonna sort your stuff and spit it out somewhere else.</p>


  <h1 class= "caps"> Problems </h1>
<p>I had a lot of problems trying to get this to work, mainly writing the function<br>
  and figuring out how to get it to display. Not even proud of myself. I'd say the most<br>
  notable epiphany I had was how to structure the function within the event listener.</p>


  <h1 class="caps"> Results </h1>
<p>Here's the input thing, there is nothing creative about it. Note the output before you input i guess!!!</p>
  <form id="user-name" action="/action_page.php">
    <label color= yellow for="fname">Enter your name.</label>

    <input type="text" id="the-input" name="fname">
