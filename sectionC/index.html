    <p id=caption>       This video is just here for practice, and I only chose it because it was like the <br>most recent video I had downloaded on my computer, but it's a tiktok of this lady <br>who got pepper-sprayed at the capitol. It's only funny because she <i>didn't</i> get seriously<br> hurt, I guess. But she is like really trippin about the whole revolution thing, which is <br>what makes it interesting. </p>

<p>This picture is called pingo.png and it's completely unrelated, it's just another<br> image I keep to test out changes and stuff, although I do find the design of the<br> club penguin penguins to be pretty funny.</p>
