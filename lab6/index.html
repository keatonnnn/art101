	<h1> Problems! </h1>
			<p> The biggest problem I ran into for this Lab was trying to get into typing <br>
				in js again; I found that I kept making mistakes and getting syntax errors and <br>
				stuff during the first portion. Other than that, once I got used to following all<br>
				 the rules, it makes sense to me so far. </p>
