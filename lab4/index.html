	<h1>Lab fourrr</h1>

	<h2>Challenges</h2>
<p><span>The goal of the task was to pseudocode a regular task and a computer task.<br>We had trouble trying to find a high level task to flesh out into steps.<br>Neither of us is very familiar with computers input user information,<br> so we wanted to use a task that was straight forward and simple to break down into steps.<span></p>
	<h2>Problems</h2>
<p>One problem we ran into was detailing some of the processes in the <br>pseudocode of the computer task, as we weren't sure how some of the tasks <br> were supposed to be structured, or how to structure some <br>of the alternatives. </p>
	<h2>Results</h2>

<p> Here is the second set of pseudocode inside Atom, it has some sub-steps and <br>stuff but I'm still not sure how close it would be. The idea was things like recaptcha <br>that like test whether or not you're a reobot; we thought about the possible forms<br> it creates and the fields for the user input, and how it tests to see if you're right.</p>

<p>These are the pseudocoded instructions to washing the interior of your car, which<br>
I suppose appear to have much better instructions, but this was a task we were much<br>
more familiar with.</p>
