	<div><h1> Challenge </h1></div>
		<p> The challenge for this Lab was to both create this page as well as the js sheet which<br> is linked to this one <strike>but so far I suppose can only be viewed in the javascript console. </strike></p>

	<img src="img/dinka.png"

	<h1> Problems </h1>
			<p> The biggest problem I ran into for this Lab was figuring out how to get the<br> document.writeIn to work, as originally nothing showed up on my page. I just <br> figured out which parts of the output were which, and now I guess I understand <br>referencing the variables more.
