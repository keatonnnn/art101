<h1>Subject of This Lab</h1>
<p>The purpose of Lab 3 was to make sure our file structure was in order
	 <br> (mine was done already because of the template) and probably to
	 <br>practice navigating/working in different files as well.
</p>

<h1>Difficulties I Encountered</h1>
<p>The biggest difficulty I ran into during this task was
	finding a <br>good picture of myself. I didn't find that
	<i>good</i> of a picture either, <br> I just asked somebody
	for a picture of me for my page because <br>I don't really
	have any.
