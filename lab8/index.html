  <h1> Challenge </h1>
<p>The challenge for this lab was to test out some functions, anonymous functions, setTimeout, stuff like that...</p>

    <h1> Problems </h1>

<p>My biggest problem was wrapping my head around some of the first instructions: <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <i>"For your first test, call the three functions in order using "TEST 1" as the argument<br>
  For your second test, use setTimeout() and an anonymous function to call your 3 <br>
  functions with "TEST 2" as an argument. For your third test, like test 2 but adjust <br>
  the times of setTimeout() so your "TEST 3" functions print in the following order: 2, 3, <br>
  1. "</i>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
When I first read it, I didn't really get what the argument was or what the role of some of<br>
 the pieces of it were. I replicated how it was done in the example and figured it out like usual.
